# Austin Animal Shelter Data Project

## Data Overview
The Austin Animal Shelter Dataset gives information about adoptions, such as:
* Age
* Gender
* Outcome
* Time in shelter
* Intake time

With this information, we can infer answers to questions such as:
* Are younger animals (such as puppies) more likely to be adopted than older adult animals?
* Is there a time of the year when animals are more likely to be adopted? 
* Does receiving dogs as Christmas gifts put them in danger of being left to a shelter?

## Tools
* Python 
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Jupyter
